# Bar Chart

This is the read me for a bar chart 'made' by Siobhan Poeteray. This bar chart was an assigment for frontend class 1. 

## Background 

I took a basic chart from the [d3 github example gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery). This chart is based on one from [@mbostock](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock).


## Data
This barchart shows percentages on the x, from 0 to 12. On the y it shows the alphabet from A to Z. 
The html is seperated from the JavaScript. The data is shown in a tvs file.
